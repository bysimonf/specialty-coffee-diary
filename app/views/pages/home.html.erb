    <p>Just starting with this app in 2023, aiming for creating a stronger community around specialty coffee and a related lively discussion.</p>
    <p>We are driven by the joy of highest quality coffees, no matter if pouring a perfectly sweet espresso shot or a super fruity filter.</p>
    <p>While acurate brew recipes or origin's details are already a pretty nerdy topic, they are hard to remember most of the times without taking notes.</p>
